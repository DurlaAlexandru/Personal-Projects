# Personal-Projects


In this file you can see my personal projects.


Firstly you can start with my "PlutoServiceDesk" application. It is a simulation of a service desk app where you can write tickets and display them on the app.

I used Bootstrap and JavaScript for this one, including Local Storage and JSON for the added spice.

Hope you like it!

Thanks!
